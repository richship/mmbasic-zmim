ChangeLog
---------

Release 2:
 - Added word-wrapping
   - assumes 100 character wide console.
 - Added paging, i.e. displays [MORE] prompt when more than one page of text is
   output between input prompts
   - assumes 50 character high console.
 - Clear console before the story file starts executing.
 - Except for selecting a story file and choosing whether to write to a script
   the input prompt is now now at the bottom of the console and the contents
   only ever scroll upwards
   - this is the standard/expected behaviour for a Z-machine implementation.
 - Try to recognise when story is trying to clear the console and respond
   appropriately
   - the Z-machine provides no specific clear console instruction instruction
     so old z3 stories often just print 20-40 blank lines on the assumption that
     will be sufficient; as it probably was for a 1980s microcomputer.
 - Try to restore the original current working directory when Z-MIM exits.
 - Minor improvements to the interactive debugger.
 - Cosmetic improvements to code and README.

Release 1:
 - Initial public beta.
